## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod brings Yeslick from Baldur's Gate to BGII: SoA and ToB, with an extensive variety of banters and interjections, a new kit (Alaghor of Clangeddin) as well as a number of PC dialogues throughout the game. Yeslick is an older dwarf, a devotee of Vergadain, dwarven god of wealth and luck and Clangeddin, dwarven god of war and battle.

He tends to model himself as the father-figure of the group, and can often be found trying to help the party to reach their potential... to mixed results. He has a kind heart and a steady hand, and is loyal to the PC to the end.

>*When asked about his past, Yeslick chuckles grimly. "There ain't nothin' there ye be wantin' to know, young 'un. Trust me." From what you have gleaned, Yeslick is peculiar for a dwarf; a follower of Vergadain, the Dwarven god of wealth and luck and Clangeddin, Dwarven god of war, he is an unassuming companion with an aversion to alcohol and the undead. You know little about his history beyond that he grew up in the Dales to the north and that heat makes him extremely irritable.*

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility


This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

The Yeslick NPC mod should be compatible with all WeiDU mods, however, we cannot test every single one. It is only compatible with BGII: ToB. If you do encounter an error, please contact <a href="kae@spellholdstudios.net">K'aeloree</a> or alternatively post on the <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/609-yeslick/">forums</a>.

>Please install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a>. Some parts of the mod may not work correctly without it.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-yeslicknpc.exe`**, un-install the previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: yeslicknpc folder.</em>

<em>When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.</em>

**Disable any antivirus** or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: yeslicknpc folder and a setup-yeslicknpc.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-yeslicknpc.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-yeslicknpc.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the component settings.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-yeslicknpc --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

	- Added *yeslicknpc.ini* metadata file to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".

The inventory BAM must have two sequences, the first containing the "large" inventory icon frame and the second containing the "small" inventory icon frame to be processed. Inventory icon BAMs in the bam folder that meet these requirements are patched and saved back to the override folder.

	- Externalized tp2 code into *main_component.tpa* library for more comfortable readability and maintenance.
